## Mobile Assignment

The goal of the assignment is to get a picture of your programming skills and coding style.

Feel free to use 3rd party frameworks and libraries when needed, but try to choose lightweight ones because we'd also like to see how you think and code.

Don't stress if you can't get every part done -- spend a maximum of 3 hours on this assignment. Feel free to add comments or README notes to help us understand your thinking and decisions.

Submit your code through `github.com` by creating a **private** repository and sharing it with the `csabaujvari` github account.

## Assignment

1. Add a feature that allows users to add products to a cart. The cart should display the total number of items and the total price of all the items in the cart.
1. Implement a custom business logic that involves calculating the total price of the products in the cart and applying discounts based on the total price.
    1. The discounts should be applied to the total price of the products in the cart and should be displayed to the user.
    1. The discounts should be applied to the total price of the products in the cart.
    1. If the total price of the products in the cart is greater than $100, a discount of 10% should be applied.
    1. If the total price of the products in the cart is greater than $200, a discount of 20% should be applied.
    1. If the total price of the products in the cart is greater than $300, a discount of 30% should be applied.
1. Implement a responsive design that makes the application look good on both iOS and Android devices, taking into account different screen sizes and aspect ratios.
1. Divide the application into different parts or layers, each with its own clear purpose, such as presentation layer, business logic layer, data access layer, and networking layer
1. Use a local database (e.g. sqflite) to store the products, and use the provider package to manage the state of the application.
1. Use Git for version control and GitHub for code sharing.
1. Create a detailed document that explains the architecture of the application, the technologies used, and the reasoning behind the design decisions made, especially the business logic for calculating the total price and applying discounts.
1. Share your code repository with `csabaujvari` github account.
