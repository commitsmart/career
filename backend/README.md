## Back-end Assignment

The goal of the assignment is to get a picture of your programming skills and coding style.

You can choose any programming language that you're comfortable with.

Feel free to use 3rd party frameworks and libraries when needed, but try to choose lightweight ones because we'd also like to see how you think and code. Koa (NodeJS), Flask (Python) or Sinatra (Ruby) are good examples of frameworks that give you just the basics and let you figure out the rest.

Don't stress if you can't get every part done -- spend a maximum of 3 hours on this assignment. Feel free to add comments or README notes to help us understand your thinking and decisions.

Submit your code through `github.com` by creating a **private** repository and sharing it with the `csabaujvari` github account.

## Assignment

1. Create an application that connects to a MongoDB database and performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on a collection.
1. Implement a concurrency mechanism that allows the application to handle a large number of concurrent requests.
1. Implement a custom business logic that involves data encryption and decryption for sensitive fields in the collection.
1. Use an Object-Document Mapping (ODM) framework (e.g. Mongoose) to handle the database operations.
1. Create a REST API for the application.
1. Add unit tests to test the main parts of the application.
1. Use Git for version control and GitHub for code sharing.
1. Create a detailed document that explains the architecture of the application, the technologies used, and the reasoning behind the design decisions made, especially the encryption and decryption mechanism.
1. Create a Dockerfile to containerize the application, and a docker-compose.yml file that sets up the application and the MongoDB database.
1. Share your code repository with `csabaujvari` github account.
