## Front-end Assignment

The goal of the assignment is to get a picture of your programming skills and coding style.

You can choose any programming language that you're comfortable with.

Feel free to use 3rd party frameworks and libraries when needed, but try to choose lightweight ones because we'd also like to see how you think and code.

Don't stress if you can't get every part done -- spend a maximum of 3 hours on this assignment. Feel free to add comments or README notes to help us understand your thinking and decisions.

Submit your code through `github.com` by creating a **private** repository and sharing it with the `commitsmart-jobs` github account.

## Assignment 

Implementation of an information interface for tourists. Where you find information about the planned destination. (Responsive design is advantage, but do not focus on this, it is enough if we can check the functions on desktop)

(Example) https://tripscout.co/

## Evaluation Criteria

1. Two languages content (enough to write content in 1 language but have two translate files that the user can change)
2. The list elements (location, descriptions of locations, pictures of  locations, ratingsâ€¦ etc.) should be returned to the feed by a fake response. Prepared for a real synchronous or asynchronous API communication.
3. Search box: It should search in the full list based on the 1-1 text parameter of the location
4. Making an Infinite scroll  for the feed.

In the time remaining (if you had any) you can create more functions to show us more about your technical knowledge. We would be very appreciated.
