# Commit Smart 

### Back-end Assignment

The goal of the assignment is to get a picture of your programming skills and coding style.

You can choose any programming language that you're comfortable with.

Feel free to use 3rd party frameworks and libraries when needed, but try to choose lightweight ones because we'd also like to see how you think and code. Koa (NodeJS), Flask (Python) or Sinatra (Ruby) are good examples of frameworks that give you just the basics and let you figure out the rest.

Don't stress if you can't get every part done -- spend a maximum of 3 hours on this assignment. Feel free to add comments or README notes to help us understand your thinking and decisions.

Submit your code through `github.com` by creating a **private** repository and sharing it with the `csabaujvari` github account.
