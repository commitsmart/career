## Assignment

**1. Bug Reporting**

You are testing a new feature on a mobile app that allows users to book flights. During testing, you noticed that the app crashes when a user attempts to select a flight from a list of search results. Your task is to report the bug to the development team.

Task:
Write a clear and concise bug report for the issue you have identified. Your bug report should be written in a professional tone and include any info that can help the development team reproduce and debug the issue. Be sure to prioritise clarity and accuracy in your report, and provide as much detail as possible to help the development team address the issue.

**2. Test Case Design**

You are testing an e-commerce website. Your task is to test the wishlist feature. Customers can add products they like to their wishlist and later move them to their shopping cart to purchase. However, only products that are currently in stock can be added to the wishlist. 

Task:
Write test cases for this feature that cover both positive and negative scenarios. Formulate at least one question about the function, the answer to which may influence the expected result in a possible scenario.

**3. Browser Developer Tools Usage**

You are testing a website and need to use the browser developer tools to identify an issue. The issue is that when a user clicks on a button, nothing happens. Using the browser developer tools, find the cause of the issue and provide a solution to fix it.
