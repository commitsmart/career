## DevOps Assignment

The goal of the assignment is to get a picture of your programming skills and coding style.

Don't stress if you can't get every part done -- spend a maximum of 3 hours on this assignment. Feel free to add comments or README notes to help us understand your thinking and decisions.

Submit your code through `github.com` by creating a **private** repository and sharing it with the `csabaujvari` github account.

## Assignment

1. Create a Terraform configuration that provisions a GCP Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster, including the necessary resources such as the cluster, nodes, and firewall rules.
1. Use Terraform to provision a GCP Persistent Disk and attach it to the cluster.
1. Use Terraform to provision a GCP Cloud SQL instance and create a database on it.
1. Use Terraform to provision a GCP Cloud Storage bucket and upload a file to it.
1. Use Git for version control and GitHub for code sharing.
1. Create a Kubernetes deployment and service configuration that deploys a simple web application on the cluster and exposes it to the internet.
1. Use your favorite CI/CD solution (Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI, etc) to deploy Kubernetes resources.
1. Create a detailed document that explains the architecture of the infrastructure, the technologies used, and the reasoning behind the design decisions made.
1. Create a script that automates the process of applying the Terraform configuration and running the test (if you have).
1. Share your code repository with `csabaujvari` github account.

**Advanced Task:**

1. Create a Kubernetes Horizontal Autoscaler that automatically scales the number of replicas of the web application based on CPU and MEM usage.
